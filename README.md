# Trafic-sign-classification-using-keras
Using Keras as base library for the classification, this classifier classifies the traffic signs using German traffic sign dataset. Using Keras for fitting data into the model. Though it took 50 epochs I still recommend 30 epochs because just for 0.5% of accuracy is not worth the time if you need more accuracy then use more dataset from kaggle.
